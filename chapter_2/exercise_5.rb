# Look at the following programs...

# x = 0
# 3.times do
#   x += 1
# end
# puts x

# and

# y = 0
# 3.times do
#   y += 1
#   x = y
# end
# puts x

# What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

# ANSWER

# In the first case, the output will be 3.

# In the second case, an error indicating an undefined local variable named x.
