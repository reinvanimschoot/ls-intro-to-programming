# What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

# 1. arr.index(5)
# Returns the index of the first match, which is 3.

# 2. arr.index[5]
# This would return an error since this an incorrect syntax usage.

# 3. arr[5]
# This returns the value at index 5, which is 8.
